        A Mehndi Party Guide for First-Time Attendees
        A mehndi party is a pre-wedding celebration in Hindu and Sikh culture; during this event, the bride has a red-orange mehndi "stain" applied to her palms, the back of her hands, and her feet. "The family and friends of the bride adorn her with this orange, plant-based dye to 'decorate' her as the bride," says Sonal J.</p>
